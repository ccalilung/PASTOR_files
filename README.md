# PASTOR

The Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcommes Registry (PASTOR) is a 20 minute survey that produces a comprehensive report of a patient's chronic pain. PASTOR was developed in response to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2010 recommendation for "performance measures used to determine the effectiveness of the policy in improving pain care for beneficiaries enrolled in the military health care system."

PASTOR consists of several static questionnaires, as well as computer assisted testing (CAT) technology developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These latter instruments, collectively known as the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) allows for a comparison of a patient's reported condition with the U.S. population. For more information on the PROMIS system, visit the Defense and Veterans Center for Integrative Pain Management (DVCIPM) website and view the video on PASTOR located on this page: https://www.dvcipm.org/clinical-resources/pain-assessment-screening-tool-and-outcomes-registry-pastor/

In this repository, you will find HTML/Javascript code for several of PASTOR's static questionnaires. Adding the CAT instruments will require access to the Assessment Center API (AC-API).
